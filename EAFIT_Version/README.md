# LaTex-Note-Taking-Template

This is a template to take notes for University Lectures, courses or whatever
notes you want to take.

## Acknowledgement

I used this [LaTeX template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/report-template-v1-dot-0/xvtpxwgvmwyr) from **Kerr Beeldens** as a base for this one.
